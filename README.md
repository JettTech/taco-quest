## Launching a development environment
1. cd over to this project directory
2. Run `npm i`
3. Run `npm i -g firebase-tools`
4. Wait for that to finish up
5. Run `firebase login`
6. Login with the browser window that pops up. Make sure you’re authenticated for the Taco Quest app. Talk to Kim.
7. Run `firebase serve`. You’re now running the DB locally. Awesome!
8. Next, run `yarn run dev` in another terminal window, same directory.
> If you get an error (yarn not installed), run `brew install yarn`, let it install yarn, then try again. Installation should take a couple minutes.
9. Profit!
